_*Fig.*_ asthma and taxi trips ended in the same zip code. Notice majority of the zipcodes has very small number of 
taxi trips ended in them. Yet, for those zipcode the variation in discharge rate for asthma hospitalization is very large. 
This might indicate some aspects of the hospitalization discharge rate is not influenced by the taxi trips. 


## next week project might involve based on this basic visualization to investigate the geographical features of those 
two variables. See if there is a location features that can be discovered with clustering technique.
