# Peer Review (Author: Anupama Santhosh)

![image of asthma vs. taxi](https://github.com/td928/PUI2017_td928/blob/master/HW8_td928/asthma_taxi.png)


_*Fig.*_ asthma and taxi trips ended in the same zip code. Notice majority of the zipcodes has very small number of 
taxi trips ended in them. Yet, for those zipcode the variation in discharge rate for asthma hospitalization is very large. 
This might indicate some aspects of the hospitalization discharge rate is not influenced by the taxi trips.

## Review for the plot

Clarity: The plot is easy to read with the titles and the caption. But what the plot is trying to convey is a bit ambiguous. The variables arent correlated and
no clear relationship seem to exist between the chosen variables. Had there been a good correlation, it could have been a good example of "Correlation doesn't 
necessarily mean correlation" plots. But from a visualization stand point, the plot is clear and complete with respect to the captions and titles

Esthetic: The figure is complies with a standard line fit plot. Some suggestions - The figure size could have been bigger so as to avoid cluttering around zero.
Equation could have been on the top right corner. It now slightly overlaps with the data. The correlation figure could have been included within the plot as agianst 
having it with the title. Overall it looks neat.

Honesty: Te has honestly reproduced the data and plotted the figure. References to the data would have backed it up. It looks like an original plot but the chosen 
variables could have been of more pertinence.
