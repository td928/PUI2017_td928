# Review

A very interesting plot. It provides a very intuitive look into the geospatial distribution for the recycle bins 
in NYC. 

A couple of suggestions on how to improve the plot:

1. Adding a scale as a legend to the graph. For someone familiar with NYC, this might not be necessary but scale could 
be helpful for someone wanting to know, for example, how far away two bins are. 

2. The color scheme for the graph could be rendered more clearly. The blue dots and grey background does occasionally 
blend together espeically near the boundaries.

3. I would also suggest to highlight the bins in different borough with different colord since you mentioned in caption 
that recycle bins are unevenly distributed in different regions and this is something you want the viewer to specifically
pay attention to. 

Overall I think it is really good work!
