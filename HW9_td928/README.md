# Assignment 2

this assignment is completed alone.

The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with census data and using the Geopandas for analysis.

The first part of the assignment requires getting broadband related data from the census data and plot the information
on a NYC map to show the discrepancies in internet access in different regions.

The second part of the assignment uses the linkNYC stations location data to validate whether the stations are providing
internet service to regions without internet access as stations are advertised. The results are showing that most of the
NYC stations are located at places where there are already high internet access rate.
