caption: This plot is showing the relationship between the assessed value of property in a community district and the square footage of various kinds of property in that district. The Y and X axes are the same across plots to allow for an intuitive comparison. Shown in black is the regression line generated from the points seen in grey - each point corresponds to a certain community district. The range of the y axes are $0 - $4,000,000, and the range of the x axes are 0 - 4e8 square feet. The trend lines show the positive relationship between square footage and value, which is meant to communicate that areas that are more built up are by and large more valuable.


It is really a cool idea to look at those relationships between assessed value and building area side by side.

Here are few of my suggestions on how to improve the graph:

1. Axes:it is interesting to look at all the relationship under the same scale to contrast. But I think some of clarity is also lost in the process.
* the y-axis ranges from 0 - 400,000,000, which is a big range. It is almost impossible to tell the value for each indicidual point. 
* the x-axis range is wide and the bottom graph(Retail Building Area) has all of its points squeezed into the lower left coner.

2. Regression line
* no information about the slope of the regression line is provided. 
* since the regression line is different length. It is difficult to compare them. 

3. Title: even though it is made clear in the caption what the graph is about. I think it helps the viewer to have a title at the top.

Overall, I would reconsider the importances of all the extreme values for the graph. If it is really necessary I think separate plots for each of the categories might be considered.
