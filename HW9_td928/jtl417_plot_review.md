# Plot Review for jtl417

*Caption*: This plot is showing the relationship between the assessed value of property in a community district and the square footage of various kinds of property in that district. The Y and X axes are the same across plots to allow for an intuitive comparison. Shown in black is the regression line generated from the points seen in grey - each point corresponds to a certain community district. The range of the y axes are $0 - $4,000,000, and the range of the x axes are 0 - 4e8 square feet. The trend lines show the positive relationship between square footage and value, which is meant to communicate that areas that are more built up are by and large more valuable.

# Review:

It is really a cool idea to look at those relationships between assessed value and building area side by side.

Here are few of my suggestions on how to improve the graph:

1. Axes:it is interesting to look at all the relationship under the same scale to contrast. But I think some of clarity is also lost in the process.
* the y-axis ranges from 0 - 400,000,000, which is a big range. It is almost impossible to tell the value for each indicidual point. 
* the x-axis range is wide and the bottom graph(Retail Building Area) has all of its points squeezed into the lower left coner.

2. Regression line
* no information about the slope of the regression line is provided. 
* since the regression line is different length. It is difficult to compare them. 

3. Title: even though it is made clear in the caption what the graph is about. I think it helps the viewer to have a title at the top.

Overall, I would reconsider the importances of all the extreme values for the graph. If they are essential, I think separate axes scales for each of the categories might be considered.

**esthetics** the poor resolution of the plot is distracting and unappealing

the points are at the enge of the x and y axis: this is a poor esthetic choice: while all the info content is there (or would be there if there were labels on the axis) it is distracting - on the other end the x axis on the right side extends inexplicably past the farthest datapoint. this unbalance is also distracting

**clarity** the points overlap and cluster in a way that makes them undistinguishable - consider using the alpha channel (transparency)

the x labeles are way too small for comfortable reading

the comparison between the slopes is difficult both because of how the plots are organized (one below the other, which is the worse organization to compare slopes) and because, as you mentioned, of the different lencth

while the multiple small plots is in the spirit of Tufte's "small multiples" the missing x and y axis are an issue. Tufte would be horrified by the omission.  With different axis length this information is essential. If all plots had the same axis span and units (like I think is the case for the y axis) it would be reasonable to omit in **all but one** of the plots
