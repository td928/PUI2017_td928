### verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly
- The idea is interesting!
- I think that you have stated the null hypothesis correctly, but not for the alternate hypothesis 
$H_1$ : $\frac{W_{\mathrm{over 60}}}{W} - \frac{M_{\mathrm{weekend}}}{M} > 0$. I think the H1 should be (W60 / W) -(M60/M)
- btw, I suggest that you do not use 'not' word in null hypothesis, you can use less or equal to than not higher. It will be better match with H0 equation sign. 

### verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)
- Well, I think you have not properly provide the data ready for the next analysis as I can not see variable or column list regarding women and men over 60 years and number of women and men.

### chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or here, or Statistics in a Nutshell.
- I think this hypothesis can be tested using Z-test of proportion here. It will be sufficient for analyzing differences for ratio data.
